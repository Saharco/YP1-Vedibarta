This is a project for the course "234311 - Yearly Project in Software Engineering" of the Technion, developed for [The Center for Educational Technology](https://www.home.cet.ac.il/)
*Vedibarta* is an educational, social Android app written in Java and developed on Android Studio, suitable for high school students. The app encourages high-school students to engage in educational conversations with other students around their age with different backgrounds, opinions and religions, thus allowing the students to engage in a very varied conversation in class about many different, controversial topics. Existing technologies such as Facebook and WhatsApp are not suitable for these demands because in these platforms, students cannot start a conversation based entirely on characteristics. We offer a centralized app for this purpose.
